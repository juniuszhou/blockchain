two types of transactions: a sending transaction and a contract creating transaction.

A sending transaction is a standard transaction, containing a receiving address, an ether amount, a data bytearray and some other parameters, and a signature from the private key associated with the sender account.

A contract creating transaction looks like a standard transaction, except the receiving address is blank.
